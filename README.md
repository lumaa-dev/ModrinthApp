# Modrinth App
This is a very quick unofficial Modrinth app made in SwiftUI, and it uses `UserDefaults` to save "records" which are graphs of downloads and followers as shown [here](#graphics), using [Swift Charts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts), the official chart API made for SwiftUI by Apple mainly updated each year.

There is also the ["Mods"](#mods) page as well as the ["Search mods"](#search). When you click on a mod it displays [this very lazy view](#mod).

There are also more hidden features or features that are not written here.
